# Fetching AWS API using Vue.js

A project created to fetch an aws api using vue.js framework. this project is very unique because I created the algorithm that determines whether the ip address is in the cidrlist. If the ip is in the cidrlist, the box will be green and if the ip is NOT in the cidrlist, the box will be red. I am fetching the api of an algorithm that I created. Pretty cool right?
